# Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting housing prices using machine learning. The notebook explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install the necessary libraries manually:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-price-prediction.git
cd housing-price-prediction
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Housing_price.ipynb
```

3. Run the cells step by step to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various housing features and their corresponding prices. Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

## Model Performance
Different machine learning models are trained and compared in this notebook. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² are used to determine model accuracy.
